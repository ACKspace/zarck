Based on https://www.geekabit.nl/projects/some-gifts-for-me/#zork-inspired-text-adventure
this is a text adventure that contains key elements of ACKspace's history.

People not familiar with ACKspace and/or memes might have a different experience playing this. 

to compile in linux, run `make`.
To create a WebAssembly version, run `make wasm`

You can also play a version on http://zarck.ackspace.nl

Please note that this was a quick programming session; the final implementation could be a lot better, but I wanted to get it out as fast as possible (this was February 2019).
